# ðŸ¦– Dino Run with YOLO-Based Hand Gesture Control

This project is a computer vision-powered twist on the classic Chrome "Dino Run" game. The player controls the dinosaur **using hand gestures** detected in real time with a **YOLOv8 object detection model**.

ðŸŽ® Built with **Pygame** and **OpenCV**, the game includes custom animations, sprite collisions, jumping physics, and a hand-tracking input mechanism using a webcam.
